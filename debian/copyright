Comment: The actual license statement ist 'GPL-2 or W3C or BSD or MIT'; GPL-2
 and BSD are ambiguous (is GPL-2 "or later"? How-many-clause BSD? Which version
 of the MIT license?) and thus left out of the machine readable part. The W3C
 license is assumed to be the one used in other files in the same project.

Comment: The wording (or variant) of the BSD license in question was traced
 back to the original source of the files and the license statement there at
 https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/master/LICENSE .

Files: test/w3c/turtle/*
Copyright: W3C
License: W3C-Test-Suite or W3C-3-clause-BSD
Comment: The wording in test/w3c/turtle/LICENSE states "under both [this] and
 [that license]". This is commonly understood to mean that complying with any
 is sufficient, which is detailed on
 https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/04-testsuite-copyright, where it is
 stated that "The choice of license is up to the licensee for every single use
 of tests from a W3C Test Suite."
