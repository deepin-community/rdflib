* jsonlayer.py may be duplicate of python-sparql-wrapper
   rdflib/plugins/sparql/results/jsonlayer.py
* rdflib/plugins/parsers/pyRdfa/ may be packaged separately
   (https://github.com/RDFLib/pyrdfa3) => apparently not if reading
   https://github.com/RDFLib/pyrdfa3/blob/master/README.md#warning-deprecated-package correctly.
* rdflib/plugins/parsers/pyMicrodata/ :
   https://github.com/RDFLib/pymicrodata 
   package as a lib on its own ?
* rdfpipe ?
   cf. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=655039#20
* reverse dependencies :
   $> apt-cache rdepends python-rdflib
   python-selenium
   swaml
   python-sparqlwrapper
   python-feedvalidator
   buxon
   
   see: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=655039#35
* Maybe not ship static files from the armstrong theme in sphinx docs
   ... ?
* Make sure why tests don't pass for Python3
* Maybe provide command-line tools for Python 3 some day. For the
   moment, KISS with only Python2.
* Move command-line tools out of librarys section and into a non-library-named
  package
* Fix clean target (tricky: python3's setup target does the 2to3 steps in
  the clean step; this doesn't even sound forbidden by the policy taken
  literally, but does not work well with git-buildpackage)
